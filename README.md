<!--### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with an interest in cyber security. I'm currently working on "Get Outside", a disability-friendly location index. This is currently a secret project as I'm working on it for my coursework at university.

The technologies that I'm well versed in are:

- Java
- Kotlin
  - Android + Jetpack Compose
- TypeScript
- Angular
- PostgreSQL

I enjoy experimenting with different languages and software - I'm currently trying out Fedora Linux on my laptop.-->
